# Unit 1 Practice Problems

This is a list of problems that are all fair game by the end of this module. If you can solve all of these, you are in awesome shape. If you
find some of these to be difficult, that's okay, keep practicing them until you are comfortable with them. 
Please practice these problems and study them. You will see some of them again. Use this a study guide for this module.


1. Write a function `equalTo` that takes in two inputs and checks whether the two
inputs are identical.

2. Write a function `or` that takes in two inputs and returns a boolean of whether at least one has a truthy value.

3. Write a function `and` that takes in two arguments and returns a boolean of whether both arguments have a truthy value.

4. Write a function `printAGrade` that takes in a number between 1 and 100. It should return the grades A, B, C, D, or F. Anything over a hundred should be considered an A.

5. `FizzBuzz` - a function that console logs  all the numbers from 1 to 100, with three exceptions. For numbers divisible by only 3, log "Fizz" instead of the number, for numbers divisible by only 5 log "Buzz" instead, and for numbers divisible by 3 and 5 log "FizzBuzz".

6. `getEvens` - takes an array as an argument and returns only the even elements.

7. `median` - takes in an array and returns the median. If the length is even it returns the average of the middle elements.

8. `switchCase` - takes in a string and returns a string with every other letter alternating between capital and lowercase.

9. `counter` -  a function that returns an object that has a count of each characters occurrence. Don't worry about punctuation, ignore spaces, but it should be case insensitive.

10. `countZeroes` - a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the amount of zeroes that occur in it.

11. `isPalindrome` - a function that takes in a string and returns whether that string is a palindrome.

12. `includes` - a function that takes in an array and a target. Returns a boolean whether or not the target is included in the function.

13. `getMiddle` - function that returns the middle character of a string. If the length is even it should return the middle two characters.

14. `palindromeSubstrings` - a function that takes in a string and returns an array of all the palindrome substrings.

15. `disemvowel` - a function that removes all the vowels from a string.

16. `targetIndices` - a function that takes in array of numbers and a target. Return the indices as an array of the pair of elements that add up to that target.

17. `rangeWithStep` - a function that takes three number variables: min, max and step. The block will log an array with all the numbers, inclusive, between min and max, , going up in increments equal to step. If no step value is provided, the increment will be 1.

18. `doubler` - a function that doubles each element in an array.

19. `largest` - a function that returns the largest number in an array.

20. `secondLargest` - a function that returns the second largest value in an array.

21. `factors` - a function that returns the factors of a number in ascending order.

22. `sum` - a function that returns the sum of all numbers.

23. `product` - a function that returns the product of all numbers.

24. `getProps` - a function that takes in an object and returns the keys .

25. `getValues` - a function that takes in an object and returns the values.

26. `getAverageAge` - a function that takes in an array of people objects. It should return the average age of all the objects.

27. `myRotate` - a function that takes in an array and a shift number. The array should be rotated by that shift number. The shift should default to zero.

``` js
myRotate([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3, 1]
myRotate([1, 2, 3], -1) // => [3, 1, 2]

```

28. `repeat` - a function that takes in a string and numberOfTimes. The function should log to the screen the string however many times as numberOfTimes. If the user does not enter a numberOfTimes it should default to 2.

29. `noDups` - a function that takes in an array and returns an array with no duplicate elements.

30. `concatAndRemoveDupes` - a function that takes in two arrays and returns one array with no duplicates elements.

31. `elementDivisibleBy` - a function that takes in a divisor and arr. Use filter to return a new array of every element of arr that can be evenly divided by divisor.

32. `numberTimesIdx` - a function that takes in an array and returns an array with each element multiplied by it's index.

33. `Array.prototype.myFlatten` - a function on the Array class that takes a multi dimensional array and returns it as one array.

34.  `Array.prototype.myForEach` - your own forEach

35. `Array.prototype.myMap` - your own map.

36. `Array.prototype.myReduce` - your own reduce.

37. `Array.prototype.myEvery` - your own every.

38. `Array.prototype.mySome` - your own some.

39. `Array.prototype.myFilter` - your own filter.

40. `Array.prototype.myTranspose` - transpose a matrix.

41. `Array.prototype.myJoin` - your own join.

42. `String.prototype.mySlice` - your own slice.
